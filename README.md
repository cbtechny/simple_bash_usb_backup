# Bash Script: Takes a folder, zips, then copies it to USB directory

Simple backup for USB drives that copies a folder from host computer and stores a zipped backup on a stick drive or other USB.

Along with digital backups and version control, this can save your skin if all fails. You know, *just in case*.

1. Put this script in your USB
2. Personalize your paths
3. Hope you never run into an issue where you need this many backups, hehe

**Important**

You must chmod the script before use. ["chmod"](http://cets.seas.upenn.edu/answers/chmod.html)
